# vue-fsm
Finite State Machines for Vue.js

## About
This library is rather a proof of concept, and not intended to be used in production. It is highly opinionated and isn't meant to follow idiomatic javascript conventions. However it is open for feedback, suggestions for improvement and contributions.

## Installation & Usage

See the examples provided, until I build a proper doc ;)

## TODO

* Distribute it as a module (NPM, CommonJS, ES6, AMD, etc...)
* Remove dependency from jQuery
* Make it extensible with plugins
* Improve the implementation
* Add functional tests
* Performance testing
* Improve the docs
