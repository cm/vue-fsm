# vue-fsm
Finite State Machines for Vue.js

## About
This library is rather a proof of concept, and not intended to be used in production. It is highly opinionated and isn't meant to follow idiomatic javascript conventions. However it is open for feedback, suggestions for improvement and contributions.



## Installation & Usage

See the examples provided, until I build a proper doc ;)

## Plugins

Base functionnality can be extended via plugins. Plugins provide with:

* New methods, inyected into the FSM prototype and available to all instances
* DSLs to express actions inline in the FSM declaration rather than as methods

Have a look at the provided sample plugins.

## TODO

* Distribute it as a module (NPM, CommonJS, ES6, AMD, etc...)
* Remove dependency from jQuery
* --Make it extensible with plugins--
* Improve the implementation
* Add functional tests
* Performance testing
* Improve the docs
